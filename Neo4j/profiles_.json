        "description": "Energy efficiency is a critical priority for IT managers because energy and power costs can be a significant portion of IT costs. Thus, understanding and investing in energy management is critical. With IBM\u00ae Systems Director Active Energy Manager\u2122, an extension of IBM Systems Director, you can monitor and manage the power usage of systems. Originally designed to support IBM BladeCenter\u00ae and System x\u00ae, Active Energy Manager now supports the power management of additional IBM systems, including System z\u00ae mainframes and POWER6\u00ae processor-based systems, as well as storage devices using an intelligent Power Distribution Unit (PDU+).\n\nActive Energy Manager helps determine the proper power allocation for each system in the data center. It can assist in determining how to allocate power to existing systems more efficiently so that additional systems can be accommodated without the need for additional power and cooling infrastructure. When power is constrained, the power management functions of Active Energy Manager allow power to be rationed on a system-by-system basis, enabling available processing power to match current workload closely.\n\nThis IBM Redbooks\u00ae publication can help system administrators effectively monitor and manage the power usage of systems in a data center. This book introduces energy management concepts and technologies, and then provides a step-by-step guide to implementing and using Active Energy Manager.\nTable of contents\n\nChapter 1. Introducing IBM energy management\nChapter 2. Planning for Active Energy Manager\nChapter 3. Installing Active Energy Manager\nChapter 4. Navigating the IBM Systems Director Web console\nChapter 5. Getting started with Active Energy Manager\nChapter 6. Monitoring Active Energy Manager resources\nChapter 7. Managing Active Energy Manager resources\nChapter 8. Using a PDU with Active Energy Manager\nChapter 9. Using sensors with Active Energy Manager\nChapter 10. Integrating facility managers with Active Energy Manager\n",

Consider me as a \u201cJack of All Trades!\u201d kind of guy who takes real pleasure in trying to understand complex topics and how they have formed.  I love to explain to myself and others in a simpler way so that there is a greater understanding and appreciation for the topic and how these can apply to real-life implementations.\n\nI've had a diverse career including entrepreneurship, building firms in partnerships and working for varying size corporations. Started my career as tech support engineer troubleshooting office automation equipment (coffee makers to computers, photocopiers to fax machines) in Bangalore. These skills helped me take on the role of a subject matter expert who assisted marketing teams with corporate demonstrations with the successful closing of deals. Subsequently, I started my own firm in Hyderabad that took end to end ownership of customer experience in office automation equipment (sales to service).  After growing the firm to a decent scale in early 2000, I switched my career to become an Consultant Architect / Technical instructor as I realized that I enjoyed learning and helping others learn new and complex topics. Over the last 18 years, I developed a unique teaching style which is greatly appreciated by my students & customers who are from diverse backgrounds. I have an exceptional ability to master new technologies and apply their full range of capabilities. As a professional speaker, I\u2019m an outstanding communicator who is patient, personable, receptive and articulated.\n\nI\u2019m always looking for new technologies to learn and solve challenges, so if you've got a challenge you need a hand with, feel free to contact me directly.\n\n\" I Teach, So I Can learn \"\n\n ",

Give a mediocre idea to a good team, and they\u2019ll find a way to make it better.\u201d \n(Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups)\n\nI am energized by understanding what goes on in teams and how we can create the best team experience a reality for all. Teams are the key ingredient for organisational success. Engagement lives on teams, we innovate on teams, customers experience our organisation through teams and our personal fulfilment and overall performance its generated through teams. It is imperative for organisations to get teams right but often the focus lands elsewhere. \n\nI hold a natural curiosity to explore the dynamics that oil the wheels of team interactions as what goes on between people really counts: Why do certain groups add up to be greater than the sum of their parts, while others add up to be less?\n\nBuilding on 17 years of experience in the L&D Industry I have solid foundations in helping lift performance within organisations. I am currently working within Cisco\u2019s People and Communities organisation dedicated to making more teams like the Cisco best teams. Cisco\u2019s has been voted the #1 place in the world to work which is a reflection on the focus and investment we have made to unleash the Power of Teams. In my role as a Team Consultant, I consult with leaders to explore a team\u2019s current state, validate reality through discovery techniques and intelligence, dream a new vision for the future and design and deliver team coaching engagements with the goal to identify and embed meaningful change. We take a strengths approach to our work driving understanding of the diversity and uniqueness of the individuals within each team knowing teams are well rounded because those within them are not. Research is at the core of what we deliver to generate the employee experience we all crave.\n\nPassions: Team Coaching, Relationship Systems Intelligence (RSI), Emotional Intelligence, Team Dynamics, Social Connectedness, Design Thinking, Management, Leadership, Team Performance, Mindfulness, Cultural Awareness, Change Leadership, Training Needs Analysis (TNA), E-Learning, CBT Authoring, Training Management,  Learning and Development (L&D), Blended Learning, Winning Teams, Diversity, ",

You have to pay for the load testing part of this on the spot instances \u2013 hence the (Almost).  \n\nAs an example: if you want to run a load test on 200 m1.small servers hitting your application or site, we can manage them as spot instances and it will cost you about $2.00 for an hour.  That should give you enough horsepower to emulate 50,000 users continuously providing load.  And we provide you with some pretty real-time graphs and reports when you are done. \n\nAlmost Free means you can save $ and afford to test early and often. Easy means you can gift wrap load testing to make QA simple and repeatable.\n\nThe RedLine13 Team is led by co-founders Bob Bickel, Rich Friedman and Stephen Sigwart.\n\nMy core responsibilities will be :\n\n1.

        "description": "Cache memory improves performance by reducing the speed gap between the CPU and the main memory. However, the execution time becomes unpredictable due to the cache's adaptive and dynamic behavior. Real-time applications are subject to operational deadlines and predictability is considered necessary to support them. Studies show that for embedded systems, cache locking helps determine the worst case execution time (WCET) and cache-related preemption delay. In this work, we evaluate predictability of an embedded system running real-time applications by instruction cache (I-Cache) locking. We implement an algorithm that locks the blocks that may cause more cache misses, using the Heptane simulation tool. We obtain CPU utilization measures for both cache analysis (no cache locking) and I-cache locking. Experimental results show that our proposed cache locking algorithm improves predictability and performance up to 15% locking, after that, predictability may be further enhanced by sacrificing performance.",

Experimental results show that our cache-locking algorithm may improve both predictability and performance of real-time systems.",

Is it Agile failed or we failed to understand agile values, principles and implement it right way.\nMany organizations embrace the journey of Agile without having clear purpose and plan. Few common reasons stated for doing Agile(which we have heard as a coach / consultant):\n\u2022\t\u201cLet\u2019s go Agile because everyone is doing Agile otherwise we are going to fail\u201d\n\u2022\t\u201cSomehow we need to get it done\u201d, \n\u2022\t\u201c It\u2019s another methodology, what a big deal, lets adjust people, process and tools and rollout\u201d, \n\u2022\t\u201c We need it to just showcase to clients that we have an Agile Framework\u201d\nThese thoughts and approaches would result in Agilebut , Scrumbut, Agilelike, Agilefall, Kanbantype kind of implementations without paying much attention towards Agile Values and Principles. This results in building of painful \u201cFrustration Backlog\u201d which in turn leads to pool of practitioners who would say \u201c Why I Hate Agile\u201d.\nIs your organization / team going through similar phase / state?. What is that you/we can do to minimize this frustration backlog?\nThis session will highlight some of these frustrations and possible reasons / gaps in realizing values and principles. Idea is to do problem discovery exercise so that actions can be taken to reap maximum benefits of journey of Agile.  \n",

Organizations have tried and\ntested many tools, techniques, methodologies or mechanisms to achieve best possible quality while\ntrying to meet time to market demands. Agile methods have gained prominent attention of CXO as\na strategic piece for IT and Business alignment. Many organizations have embraced agile journey in\nrecent years and have reported noticeable improvement in product quality, customer satisfaction,\nearly value delivery (Time to market) and increased people engagement at workplace. One of the\nmagical factor driving product quality improvement in Agile Scrum is Definition of Done( DoD).\nA well thought and implemented DoD would result in significant reduction of Tech Debt  and improvement of Product Quality.\nThis paper provides summary of our experience of implementation of DoD and magnificent results\nwe observed in an enterprise level large complex legacy system",

This discussion is all about how we could groom people internally to sustain and increase the credentials within the organization rather than relying always on external coaches.\n\nSession would provoke thoughts among practitioners to design and deploy unique or customized approach to groom internal agile coaching talent.\n\nOur 4S Model would help you setup your own Internal Agile Transformation Team \n\nThis is tried and tested approach and also presented earlier and liked by many.",

We want to combine best practice in recruitment with customer service and integrity, honesty and transparency. \n\nWhen people ask us what we do, the easiest thing to say is \u2018specialist IT recruitment\u2019. Specifically contract and permanent hires across the UK, with a focus on digital transformation.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t really get to the heart of why we\u2019re here.\n\nWe believe business is changing. Just look at Google, Ben & Jerry\u2019s or Toms. Not only are they wildly successful on a financial level, they\u2019re also ranked as some of the most socially responsible businesses around. Today it is those businesses pursuing social responsibility that are hitting the headlines, attracting the best talent and securing long term customer loyalty.\n\nRecruitment can be a difficult process for businesses. At SR2 we do things a bit differently. For a start, we want to make the process as simple as possible for our clients. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll work with you to create a tailored solution to your recruitment needs, whether you\u2019re looking for a one-off hire or want to create an entire campaign.\n\nPart of our commitment to putting people first is being available to businesses to offer sound recruitment advice. If it turns out you don\u2019t need to use the services of an agency, we\u2019ll tell you. We\u2019ll be happy to have shared our expertise and hopefully some day you\u2019ll have a chance to recommend us to someone who does need our help.\n\nSocially Responsible Recruitment isn\u2019t just a clever way to help us stand out from the crowd. Putting people up there alongside profits is part of our DNA and we\u2019ve committed to some pretty tangible promises in order to put that into action. \n\nPlease see our website www.sr2rec.co.uk for more information on who we are and exactly what those promises are or feel free to give us a call on 0117 363 7407",

The search can run on a single parameter of PINCODE or can be extended with many parameters like, event, distance and transportation type. It also contains advance search option like, languages preferences, vehicle type, gender, amenities provided.\n\nOn other side, this whole system has loaded with JomSocial to add the social networking features to know the individual preferences. We have developed custom code in JomSocial to enable mobile text messages to inform about the nearest ride search and call back alerts. This system has extended its coverage by offering state wise ride coverage search option."

As a client, it registers a file into indexing server and searches the file and list of peers which possess the file from indexing server. The user can pick one such peer and the client then connects to this peer and downloads the file. As a server, the peer sends the requested file when receiving a request.\n\nThe project consists of \n1) An Indexing server that keeps track of the files available and its locations and suggests mirror locations\n2) Peer application that will connect to the indexing server for location of the files and also serves file from its local hard drive to other Peers\n3) Both the Indexing server and File Sharing servers are build in Thread per client architecture and uses socket communication with TCP protocol \n4) The peers identifies the server using UDP broadcast messaging."

        "description": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) decouples software implementations of network functions from their hosts (or hardware). NFV exposes a new set of entities, the virtualized network functions (VNFs). The VNFs can be chained with other VNFs and physical network functions (PNFs) to realize network services. This flexibility introduced by NFV allows service providers to respond in an agile manner to variable service demands and changing business goals. In this context, the efficient establishment of service chains and their placement becomes essential to reduce capital and operational expenses and gain in service agility. This paper addresses the placement aspect of these service chains by finding the best locations and hosts for the VNFs and to steer traffic across these functions while respecting user requirements and maximizing provider revenue. We propose a novel eigendecomposition based approach for the placement of virtual and physical network functions chains in networks and cloud environments. A heuristic based on a custom greedy algorithm is also presented to compare performance and assess the capability of the eigendecomposition approach. The performance of both algorithms is compared to a multi-stage based method from the state of the art that also addresses the chaining of network services. Performance evaluation results show that our matrix based method, eigendecomposition of adjacency matrices, has reduced complexity and convergence times that essentially depend only on the physical graph sizes. Our proposal also outperforms the related work in provider\u2019s revenue and acceptance rate.",

        "description": "This paper presents two exact algorithms for energy\nefficient  scheduling  of  virtual  machines  (VMs)  in  cloud  data\ncenters. Modeling of energy aware allocation and consolidation to\nminimize overall energy consumption leads us to the combination\nof an optimal allocation algorithm with a consolidation algorithm\nrelying on migration of VMs at service departures. The optimal\nallocation  algorithm  is  solved  as  a  bin  packing  problem  with  a\nminimum  power  consumption  objective.  It  is  compared  with  an\nenergy  aware  best  fit  algorithm.  The  exact  migration  algorithm\nresults  from  a  linear  and  integer  formulation  of  VM  migration\nto  adapt  placement  when  resources  are  released.  The  proposed\nmigration  is  general  and  goes  beyond  the  current  state  of  the\nart  by  minimizing  both  the  number  of  migrations  needed  for\nconsolidation and energy consumption in a single algorithm with\na  set  of  valid  inequalities  and  conditions.  Experimental  results\nshow  the  benefits  of  combining  the  allocation  and  migration\nalgorithms  and  demonstrate  their  ability  to  achieve  significant\nenergy   savings   while   maintaining   feasible   convergence   times\nwhen  compared  with  the  best  fit  heuristic.",

        "description": "This paper presents a new graph-coloring model for advance resource reservation with minimum energy consumption in heterogeneous IaaS cloud data centers. We start with an exact integer linear programming (ILP) formulation which generalizes the graph coloring problem and follow with a fast Energy Efficient Graph Pre-coloring (EEGP) heuristic to address the scalability and to reduce convergence times. The results of performance evaluation and comparisons of EEGP with our exact algorithm and the Haizea advance reservation (AR) algorithm demonstrate the efficiency of EEGP for the energy efficient advance resource reservation problem. Our proposed EEGP heuristic is shown to perform very close to optimal, to scale well with problem size and to achieve convergence times close to the simple and fast AR algorithm that is however suboptimal.",

        "description": "As cloud computing becomes increasingly pervasive, the data center energy consumption attributable to cloud computing is climbing, despite the clarion call of action to reduce consumption and reverse environmental effects. At the same time, the rising cost of energy - due to regulatory measures enforcing a \"true cost\" of energy coupled with finite natural resources rapidly diminishing, resulting in scarcity - is refocusing IT leaders on efficiency and total cost of ownership (TCO), particularly in the context of the world-wide financial crisis. We propose a \"smart metering\" approach that encompasses all the stakeholders in the cloud computing ecosystem to achieve these twin goals of \"energy conservation\" and \"demand response\". As such, this paper introduces our initial thoughts on \"smart metering\" and various implications and implementation ideas related to it.",

        "description": "Offshore and outsourced distributed software development models and processes are facing challenges, previously unknown, with respect to computing capacity, bandwidth, storage, security, complexity, reliability, and business uncertainty. Clouds promise to address these challenges by adopting recent advances in virtualization, parallel and distributed systems, utility computing, and software services. In this paper, we envision a cloud-based platform that addresses some of these core problems. We outline a generic cloud architecture, its design and our first implementation results for three cloud forms - a compute cloud, a storage cloud and a cloud-based software service- in the context of global distributed software development (GSD). Our \u201dcompute cloud\u201d provides computational services such as continuous code integration and a compile server farm, \u201dstorage cloud\u201d offers storage (block or file-based) services with an on-line virtual storage service, whereas the on-line virtual labs represent a useful cloud service. We note some of the use cases for clouds in GSD, the lessons learned with our prototypes and identify challenges that must be conquered before realizing the full business benefits. We believe that in the future, software practitioners will focus more on these cloud computing platforms and see clouds as a means to supporting a ecosystem of clients, developers and other key stakeholders.",

        "description": "Task scheduling is an NP-hard problem. In earlier, different task scheduling algorithms are proposed for cloud computing environment. By adapting new and modified task scheduling algorithms, better resource utilization can be obtained. In real time, most of the tasks are deadline-based tasks. The deadline-based task has different parameters. The backfilling algorithm is used to schedule these types of tasks in Haizea. In this paper, we modeled the existing backfilling algorithm for scheduling deadline-based task using Petri-Net. The paper presents the design model of the existing backfilling algorithm. The model specifies real-time challenges of backfilling algorithm using Petri-Net. The work also comes forward with some design issues of backfilling algorithm using Petri-Net.",
